## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   A Google AI API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-usernamefarrosfr/ai-logo-generator
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project and add your Google AI API Key:
    ```
    API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY"
    ```
    **Note:** The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent leaking your secret API Key.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application's logic is straightforward:
1.  The user provides a business name and a desired style in the UI.
2.  On clicking "Generate Logo", these inputs are sent to a service function (`geminiService.ts`).
3.  This service formats the inputs into a descriptive prompt and makes an API call to the Google Gemini API, specifically requesting an image from the Imagen 3 model.
4.  The generated image's data is returned and displayed on the screen.
